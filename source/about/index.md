My name is Tijme Gommers. I’m a professional cyber security engineer & passionate software engineer from the Netherlands. During my career, I have contributed to large enterprise web- and mobile applications using my knowledge of, among others, **PHP**, **Java** (including the **Android SDK**), **Swift**, **C++**, **Python** and **(server-side) Java/ECMA script**. Lately, I have been conducting research related to cybernetic security, especially on web application and internet protocol level. My primary occupation is my career as a red-teamer, to protect the Netherlands against cybernetic security crimes.
