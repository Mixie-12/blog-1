**Hello awesome reader!** My name is Tijme Gommers. I'm a cyber security enthusiast, passionate software engineer & BSc student from the Netherlands. During my career, I have worked on large enterprise web- and mobile applications and API's. I've also done a lot of research on cyber security, especially on web application and internet protocol level. The programming languages which I am most familiar with are **PHP**, **Java** (including the **Android SDK**), **Swift**, **Python** and **(server-side) Java/ECMA script**. I hope to learn new development techniques soon! However, I do think that I can surprise a lot of software engineers with the knowledge I already have.
