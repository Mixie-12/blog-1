**Hello World!** My name is Tijme Gommers. I'm a passionate BSc software engineer & MSc information security student from the Netherlands. During my career, I have worked on large enterprise web- and mobile applications and API's. I've also done cyber security related research, especially on web application and internet protocol level. The programming languages which I am most familiar with are **PHP**, **Java** (including the **Android SDK**), **Swift**, **C++**, **Python** and **(server-side) Java/ECMA script**. And of course I hope to learn new development techniques soon!
