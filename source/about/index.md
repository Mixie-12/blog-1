My name is Tijme Gommers. I’m a certified cyber security specialist (OSCP) and polyglot software engineering professional who devotes time to research related to cybernetic security. Over the past years, this research mainly focused on Adversary Tactics and Red Team Operations. Before my career in cyber security I contributed to enterprise software applications using a large variety of programming languages. But what I appreciate more is developing non-commercial open-source software such as Raivo OTP ({% customlink "https://github.com/raivo-otp/ios-application" %}); a one-time-password manager that tackles my biggest annoyances related to these types of applications. My current and primary professional occupation is my career as a red teamer at Northwave, where we strive to carry out the most complex TIBER assignments.
