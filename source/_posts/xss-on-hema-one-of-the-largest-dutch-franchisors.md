subtitle: Reflected and "Stored" DOM-based cross-site-scripting on hema.nl
description: By abusing a sensitive data exposure vulnerability it is possible to steal data from a Hema user. If the user is signed in, data like the user's name and email can be stolen using cross frame scripting. Besides that, a malicious JavaScript payload can be inserted into the local storage which causes DOM-based XSS.
