Based on the evolution of web design and the responses I received on my portfolio, I decided to give my blog a new look.

Things I've used:

* My ability to form new images in my mind, also called "Imagination"
* The elements and principles of design
* The Twitter Bootstrap for easiness and responsiveness
* Grunt for easiness and performance

And why do all my blog posts have a fancy background? Why not? I'm not a designer. Whenever I create a new post, I just pick a random image from Unsplash ({% customlink "https://unsplash.com/" %}).

			<strong>Design in 2014</strong>
			{% endraw %}{% customlightbox "website-design" "design-2014.jpg" "Design in 2014" %}{% raw %}
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">

			<strong>Design in 2015</strong>
			{% endraw %}{% customlightbox "website-design" "design-2015.jpg" "Design in 2015" %}{% raw %}
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">

			<strong>Design from now on</strong>
			{% endraw %}{% customlightbox "website-design" "design-2016.jpg" "Design from now on" %}{% raw %}

	</div>
</div>
